Hello!

Just a quick freecodecamp tutorial I made to brush up on Express, React, Node, and also an opportunity to explore Mongo more.

You can [watch the tutorial here](https://link-url-here.org](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-42K44A1oMA)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-42K44A1oMA).

I deployed the project by hosting the backend on Render and the frontend on Netlify.

You can [see the project here](https://cerulean-fudge-ecfc0d.netlify.app/).

The frontend uses:

* React
* Vite
* Tailwind CSS
* react-router-dom
* axios
* react-icons
* notistack

The backend uses:

* Express
* Mongoose
* Nodemon
* dotenv
* cors

I really like the book modal which can be seen by clicking the eye in the card view and the notifications using notistack that make the UX much better.

Thanks and enjoy!
